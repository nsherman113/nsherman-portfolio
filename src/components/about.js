              Hey there ðŸ‘‹
              <br />
              <br />
              My name is Noah, I'm a full stack engineer out of Austin Texas. I
              have a background in economics, accounting and finance, as well as
              computer programming, and I'm currently looking to pursue a career
              in Software Development utlizing the Full Stack. I am proficient
              in Javascript with experience covering technologies such as
              React.js, Express, Node, MySQL, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, et al.
              <br />
              <br />
              When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy watching live music,
              traveling, reading, playing golf, being outdoors, and gaming.
              <br />
              <br />I am passionate about learning new things and working with
              others to solve problems and create more efficient processes. I
              look forward to connecting with you!
